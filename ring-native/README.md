ring-native
===========
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ring-native.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/ring-native)

The [*ring* cryptography library][ring] packaged as a RubyGem. Since *ring* has
no upstream releases, this gem will be released as periodic snapshots with
version numbers corresponding to the date the snapshot was taken until such time
as *ring* has versioned releases.

The boilerplate code in the ring-native gem is MIT along with the rest of the
ruby-ring gem, however *ring* itself is a fork of BoringSSL and therefore
carries with it a mixture of licenses, mostly the OpenSSL license.

For more information on the licensing of *ring* itself, please see the
[*ring* LICENSE][license].
